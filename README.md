# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript (jQuery). The game can be played by two players taking turns to mark cells on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, simply clone the project and open `index.html` in your browser.

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark a cell with their symbol (either `X` or `O`). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are marked and no player has won, the game is a tie.
